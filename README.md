# Classification model to predict whether a person makes over $50k a year

## Problem statement : 
Create a classification model to predict whether a person makes over $50k a year.

## Context : 
This data was extracted from the 1994 Census bureau database by Ronny Kohavi and Barry Becker (Data Mining and Visualization, Silicon Graphics).

## Details of features :
The columns are described as follows:
* Age
* Workclass
* Fnlwgt
* Education
* education_num
* marital_status
* occupation
* relationship
* race
* sex
* capital_gain
* capital_loss
* native_country
* income

## Dataset :

## Steps to create the model :

* **Data Collection :** Gather a dataset that includes features such as age, education, occupation, marital status, and capital gain/loss, as well as a label indicating whether the person makes over $50k a year.

* **Data Preprocessing :** Preprocess the dataset by removing missing values, converting categorical variables to numerical values, and scaling/normalizing the features as needed.

* **Model Selection :** Choose a classification algorithm to use for the model, such as logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, KNN or support vector machines (SVM).

* **Model Training :** Split the preprocessed dataset into training and testing sets, and use the training set to train the chosen classification model.

* **Model Evaluation :** Use the trained model to make predictions on the testing set, and evaluate its performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
